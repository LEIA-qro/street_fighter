# High-Level Summary

Transitioning from mathematical theory to bare-metal implementation requires strict modularity. To successfully bridge BizHawk and Python via Inter-Process Communication (IPC), we will establish a rigid synchronous TCP Client-Server architecture. Python will act as the TCP Server, waiting for a connection. BizHawk (via Lua) will act as the TCP Client, connecting to Python, sending the RAM state, and waiting for the neural network's action before advancing the emulator frame.

## Data recolection and BizHawk (Lua) - Python connection

The Street Fighter II' - Special Champion Edition (USA) rom uses a base-conversion artifact of the Motorola 68000 processor architecture used in the Genesis. The Genesis WRAM is mapped to the 0xFF0000 memory range this is an **Hexadecimal (Base-16)** address format. To extract this data we have to figure out, where are the changes or the data adresses that we want. 

Thankfully Bizhawk already counts with integrated tools that can help us map the desired addresses. Inside BizHawk/EmuHawk, go to Tools -> There you will be able to fin RAM Watch & RAM Search. Open both. In [`doc`](doc) there is a file called **Street Fighter II' - Special Champion Edition (U) [!].wch**, you can load this inside RAM Watch to continue searching for other desired RAM addresses. There are different techniques to finding new RAM locations, most of the player-related RAM locations are in the 0xFF8000 - 0xFF9000 range.
